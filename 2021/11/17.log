[18:52:56] <bansheeru> hey, i'm having some trouble with rendering performance and drawing textures. i'm only able to draw ~20k textured tris before i start dropping frames on the switch. my GLSL vert shader does the normal projection matrix transformations and passes UVs to the fragment shader, which consists of one line: `color = texture(sampler, uv);`. if i replace the fragment shader with a constant color, a color 
[18:53:00] <bansheeru> pulled from vertex attributes, or even a transparent color, the performance problems go away. that's why i'm pretty confident the performance problem is due to texturing in the fragment shader. i was talking to the guys on the switch homebrew discord about it and it threw everyone for a loop, so they directed me here. i'm using deko3d as my renderer, and load the textures following the official 
[18:53:06] <bansheeru> deko3d examples in `switch-examples`. you can see how i'm loading textures here: https://github.com/bansheerubber/eggine/blob/master/src/renderer/texture.cc#L89. my hypothesis is that its a texture caching issue. i'm loading the texture into memory using row-major order and i'm not doing any swizzling (whatever that means) and that could be the reason why i'm losing performance. the other texture 
[18:53:12] <bansheeru> modes for deko3d are decently cryptic, so i haven't tried any other ordering yet. i'd appreciate it if someone could take a look at it and tell me your thoughts on the matter
[18:53:32] <bansheeru> also new to irc, didn't realize that would split into 4 different messages. apologizes to the spam
