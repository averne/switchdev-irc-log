[12:51:35] <n00b639> Using the Services API, how can the switch communicate VSYNC events? I couldn't find that in `dispdrv` or `nvdrv`...
[12:52:54] <averne> n00b639: https://github.com/switchbrew/libnx/blob/master/nx/include/switch/services/vi.h#L97
[12:54:08] <averne> However the default vi display object is not directly accessible: https://github.com/switchbrew/libnx/blob/master/nx/source/display/default_window.c#L11
[12:55:20] <n00b639> That's irrelevant, I wanted to find that function in the Yuzu code, in the Discord server of these no one was able to help me... Thanks a lot for pointing that out! I'll check if it works for me.
[13:01:03] <n00b639> Wait, why is that function called GETvsync? If it gets called when the switch is done drawing a frame, shouldn't it be called SIGNAL or SET instead?
[13:05:43] <averne> it returns an event that is signaled when the screen is refreshed
[13:06:24] <n00b639> So it will do something like SIGNAL(GetDisplayVsyncEvent(id));?
[13:07:54] <averne> the screen refresh can't be controlled
[13:09:17] <n00b639> ... Then I totally misunderstood the concept of VSync so far. How will the display otherwise know whether a frame has been finished or if the game is still processing the current state?
[13:12:59] <averne> it works the other way, the display stack tells the game a frame has been displayed
[13:27:17] <n00b639> Okay, then I can't work with that method... Do you know any other method that will be called exactly once per frame? So if the game lags, it will only be called at the in-game-framerate, not the refresh rate of the monitor...
[13:30:53] <averne> it's possible by hooking to nvn calls i believe
[13:31:54] <averne> https://github.com/masagrator/NX-FPS/blob/master/source/main.cpp#L175
[13:35:16] <n00b639> I can't find anything related to `nvn` in the code of Yuzu... Only a comment about it in the GPU class. Is it another service?
[13:37:05] <averne> it's the graphics api used by most games on the switch
[13:46:54] <n00b639> Even the people on the Yuzu server don't know `nvn`...
[13:47:20] <n00b639> Yuzu has all the services implemented as High-Level-Emulators. Is there maybe a service that is getting called once per frame?
