[06:12:41] <nikitalit> Hi, I'm trying to figure out how to dump the raw HID messages coming from a real controller while playing a game; what i've read suggests that it's possible but I'm not really sure where to begin in libnx
[06:23:32] <nikitalit> yellows8: actually, I think you're just the person to talk about this. I'm looking to reverse engineer the Starlink toys, and I suspect they use the same hidbus interface that Ring-Con uses. How did you get the data going back and forth to make your analysis?
