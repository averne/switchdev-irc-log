[17:28:46] <[Escape75> Anyone alive here? :)
[17:30:01] <averne> ?
[17:31:07] <[Escape75> I’m looking for some info regarding partition layouts that nobody seems to know anything about ...
[17:32:14] <averne> if you've got a question just ask it and someone might answer
[17:32:29] <[Escape75> Well ok, i
[17:36:29] <[Escape75> Ok, ouch this irc client on the ipad blows haha ...
[17:39:06] *** Joins n87_3
[17:40:49] <[Escape75> So anyways, user and system partitions seem to use the same  structure fat32 with boot/filesystem records at sectors 0,1 and then backup at 6,7 ...
[17:41:36] <[Escape75> But there’s extra stuff in between that normally would just be empty, wondering what it might be .
[17:42:51] <[Escape75> When formatting these partitions from other OS that data gets removed of course
[17:43:14] <averne> might just be garbage?
[17:44:45] *** Quits n87_2 (Read error: Operation timed out)
[17:45:11] <[Escape75> Doesn’t look like garbage to me, possibly encrypted, i believe it’s the same on system and user, contains the word prf2safe in it.
[17:46:05] <[Escape75> I can’t confirm if it’s same as i formatted my user partition already, lol
[17:47:05] <[Escape75> Someone with a backup should be able to see it quickly and whether it’s the same between the partitions.
[17:48:53] <averne> ah, then it's probably metadata/recovery data for the FS driver (prfile2)
[17:50:34] <[Escape75> Sector 2 seems encrypted with the entire sector filled, 3 mostly empty with word prf2safe, then 4+5 filled with data again. Hmm.
[17:51:21] <[Escape75> Data doesn’t change after resets also.
[17:58:39] <[Escape75> If it’s for the fs driver when would it be actually used? I’m trying to figure out a way to reconstruct partitions from scratch, and trying to decide if that data is needed.
[18:00:55] <averne> somewhere in the fs sysmodule (0100000000000000)
