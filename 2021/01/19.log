[06:41:55] <justadev> Hello, I'm not exactly sure on how to use deko3d, what shader language do I need to learn?
[06:47:08] <justadev> I tried to look at PRIMER.md, but that has just initialization functions order and in the header I found all the functions I can call, but the order, the pipeline, the expected shader format ... that is unclear, so I decided to come here and ask the devs myself :-)
[08:10:10] <averne_> justadev: you can find examples here: https://github.com/switchbrew/switch-examples/tree/master/graphics/deko3d, generally you can also run a github-wide search for a function or something and hope someone figured it out for you
[08:10:19] *** averne_ is now known as averne
[08:14:34] <justadev> https://github.com/switchbrew/switch-examples/tree/master/graphics/deko3d/deko_examples/source
[08:14:52] <justadev> ^ just what I was looking for, how did I miss that one subdirectory? 
[08:16:06] <averne> the shader language is a slightly custom dialect of glsl, the differences are documented here: https://github.com/devkitPro/uam
