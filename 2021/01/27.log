[20:59:05] <Ideology> hello, does a homebrew need any special TID to work? is testing a homebrew as simple as opening the nro on yuzu?
[21:02:05] *** Joins phigcloud
[21:03:19] <Ideology> maybe someone can help me debug this? https://pastebin.com/raw/GprvvdgD
[21:03:43] <Ideology> yuzu just crashes after "Launching" bar
[21:06:07] <averne> homebrew launched from hbmenu doesn't have a tid
[21:06:47] <averne> going through this log it seems yuzu doesn't implement most of the stuff needed for homebrew to display
[21:07:15] <averne> i'd recommend testing with ryujinx which is generally more accurate, of course it doesn't beat testing on hardware
[21:07:51] <Ideology> i tested with hardware, and it immediately crashes the cfw forcing me to reboot so there's no real way to tell what's crashing. now i implemented some printfs to see where it gets to
[21:08:01] <Ideology> i'll try out ryujinx now
[21:08:23] <averne> do you get a fatal/abort screen?
[21:09:23] <Ideology> this error https://i.imgur.com/TDKXzua.jpg

[21:11:38] <averne> ehhh, looking past the dubious choice of cfw, that'd be a "segfault"
[21:12:18] <averne> atmosphere fatal screen will typically present you with way more useful information btw (registers, stack trace ...)
[21:13:25] <averne> can you post the code that crashes?
[21:14:12] <Ideology> here's ryujinx log: https://pastebin.com/raw/r6jZa1kq
[21:14:36] <Ideology> but uh... should i upload it as a git? or just the main?
[21:16:12] <averne> well idk, if you have a rough idea where it goes wrong then post that
[21:16:33] <Ideology> well, i mean, it doesn't even get to the first printf, so let's do that first
[21:16:43] <Ideology> sec
[21:18:35] <Ideology> https://pastebin.com/BHvJeK5y
[21:19:43] <Ideology> mostly grabbed from sdl examples
[21:20:39] <averne> replace the first line with SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO|SDL_INIT_TIMER|SDL_AUDIO);, and remove the second SDL_INIT call?
[21:20:52] <Ideology> ok
[21:21:31] <averne> oh and the 3rd SDL_INIT call too
[21:21:41] <averne> just move everything you want in the first function
[21:22:12] <Ideology> 3rd being the if ?
[21:22:30] <averne> yeah
[21:22:50] <Ideology> done
[21:24:05] <Ideology> now, my includes are in a different file, does it matter? ex: #include main.h  which has #include another file.h, which has all the actual includes such as switch.h
[21:25:46] <averne> no it will work regardless as long as all the required headers are pulled at some point, but it's good practice to include what you need in each file
