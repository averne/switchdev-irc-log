[19:19:18] <Generic> I have a weird issue with deko3d
[19:19:27] <Generic> 32*8 textures seem not work
[19:19:42] <Generic> as in only the left half is displayed
[19:19:49] <Generic> the other half has random memory
[19:20:41] <Generic> 16*8 textures seem to work again
[19:20:47] <Generic> and 32*16 textures work as well
[19:20:57] <Generic> it also works if the layout is changed to pitch linear
[19:25:43] <Generic> the format is rgba_unorm btw
[19:29:26] <Generic> ah another thing I tried was retrieving the texture back to the cpu
[19:29:31] <Generic> and it is properly uploaded
[20:26:38] <Generic> I guess I'll try to get something reproducible working
[20:26:41] <Generic> and create an issue
