[20:12:03] <Generic> hello, I just had a weird issue with copyBuffer in deko3d
[20:12:46] <Generic> I was using it to copy an entire image (both src and dst of the same format ofc)
[20:13:32] <Generic> where small segments of color would be repeated across the image
[20:14:03] <Generic> now I'm using blitImage to do the exact same copy and everything seems to work alright

[20:41:23] <averne> Generic: You're probably supposed to use copyImage for this, which is unimplemented: https://github.com/devkitPro/deko3d/blob/master/source/dk_image.cpp#L508. blitImage works as a workaround.
[20:42:54] <Generic> yeah I would have used copyImage if it as implemented
[20:43:48] <Generic> though in princible
[20:44:09] <Generic> is there anything about copyBuffer which prevents it from being used with images?
