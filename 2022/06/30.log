[16:38:15] <yellows8> fractal__: is usbHsIfSetInterface/usbHsIfGetAlternateInterface relevant for your device (if you're not already using those)?

[18:12:17] <fractal_> yellows8: yeah, I'm calling GetAlternate with a NULL to the second parameter so it replaces the current active interface in the session before trying to open the endpoints
[18:15:33] <fractal_> this might just be a limitation of working in userland/with the kernel & services?
[18:15:56] <fractal_> the device I'm trying to connect to (audio input) exposes itself as a usb audio interface and I know that the output half gets acquired immediately by the system at usbHsInitialize... but that's a completely separate interface and I can acquire the input side just fine
[18:16:56] <fractal_> it just doesn't open the endpoint, even when I manually provide correct connection information derived from the config descriptor
[18:19:09] <fractal_> the error I get is 0xc88c, but I can't find any documentation for that

[21:22:59] <hexkyz> afaik, 0xc88c is a generic "bad argument" error in the "nn::usb::HostEndpoint" namespace
[21:23:00] <hexkyz> (0xce8c is "bad aligment")
[21:35:37] <yellows8> try usbHsIfSetInterface instead
