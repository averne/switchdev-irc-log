[22:16:49] <fractal__> hi! I've been trying to do some usb-host stuff with libnx and have been running into some problems, is this the right place to ask about that?
[22:19:03] *** Quits: m4ts (Excess Flood)
[22:22:10] *** Joins: m4ts
[22:26:05] <fractal__> from what I understand, all of the usb interfaces get populated on init by the usb:hs service from the usb config descriptor, but when I try to access an available (alt) interface with a known existent endpoint, there's nothing in either of the endpoint descriptor arrays 
[22:27:18] <fractal__> the only hint I've been able to find is "descriptors which are not available are set to all-zero", but the interface is available and I can acquire it successfully
[22:29:58] <fractal__> is the endpoint descriptor just not getting populated correctly? should I populate it myself using data from the config descriptor and then pass that to usbHsIfOpenUsbEp?
