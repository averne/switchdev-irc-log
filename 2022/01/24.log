[20:01:13] <Behemoth> Trying to figure out a bug and it might be an issue in deko. He gets "dkDeviceDestroy (2--0009) unfreed memory blocks"
[20:01:14] <Behemoth> https://github.com/devkitPro/deko3d/blob/24f9e457de68ef7737ecad24cce69d08bc35f5a9/include/deko3d.hpp#L71-L84

[20:01:17] <Behemoth> I think with this assignment, the left side leaks. UniqueHandle(T&& rhs) -> operator=(UniqueHandle&& rhs) where lhs only gets cleared but not destroyed. Swapping the handles would be what I would have expected.
[20:25:30] <averne> That's pretty easy to confirm, just log something in the destructor and see if it does happen. At a glace I can't trace a call to destroy() either but it would be strange if it leaked considering most applications use that patter
[20:33:04] <Behemoth> Usually applications would create a memblock once and hand out memory chunks from that.
[20:33:42] <Behemoth> Joel confirmed it working when clearing the handle first with a nullptr assignment.

[21:08:43] <averne> I thought the imgui-deko3d port did that, maybe not
[21:08:47] <averne> Nice catch though
