[00:42:28] <xperia64> hexkyz: thanks. I'm just going to get a refund at this point; even though everything else those power/charge controller chips do seems to work, AcOk does not and the BQ behaves a little inconsistently too
[00:43:13] <xperia64> the other symptom of this issue is the switch not doing anything when it's off and you apply USB-C power
[00:43:37] <xperia64> it's just so weird fast charging and everything work fine
[00:43:58] <xperia64> you would think they would check AcOk for more than those two things

[18:58:47] <hexkyz> xperia64: yeah that's definitely a bizarre hardware issue with the pmic and/or the bq
[18:58:47] <hexkyz> also doesn't help how little documentation maxim provides for stuff like this

[21:25:45] <xperia64> we believe the pmic is fine
