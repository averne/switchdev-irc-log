[00:58:42] <xperia64> anyone happen to know what the switch's implementation of apm's `GetPerformanceMode` is looking for from the hardware? I have a defective tablet that never truly enters docked mode clocks, but HDMI/USB/full speed charging work

[19:44:36] <hexkyz> xperia64: it depends on 3 values from other services/sysmodules: IsEnoughPowerSupplied == 1 | GetBatteryVoltageState == 3 | GetAcOk == 1
[19:44:39] <hexkyz> first 2 come from psm and the last one is from bpc
[19:45:38] <hexkyz> there's also logic for forcing a performance mode by overwritting the system setting apm!performance_mode_policy (allowed values are "auto", "normal" and "boost")
[19:47:00] <hexkyz> you could try calling each of those commands and verify the results
