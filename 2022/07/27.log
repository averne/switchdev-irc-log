[01:52:31] <xperia64> hmm, tried forcing performance_mode_policy in atmosphere but that didn't work. Let me query those values.
[02:00:45] <xperia64> Ok IsEnoughPowerSupplied is true, and GetBatteryVoltageState is 3.
[02:14:32] <xperia64> and that would do it. GetAcOk is returning false (assuming I called it correctly)
[02:15:10] <xperia64> hexkyz: so then, any idea what GetAcOk is looking for?

[19:04:36] <hexkyz> xperia64: GetAcOk does a simple i2c read on the reg MAX77620_REG_ONOFFSTAT
[19:04:36] <hexkyz> it then checks if bit1 is set which is: https://github.com/CTCaer/hekate/blob/master/bdk/power/max77620.h#L130
