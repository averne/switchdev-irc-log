[10:22:14] <Behemoth> I'd guess averne would know about that. He already got NVJpeg to work.
[10:34:44] <averne> I have something wip but not public yet
[10:35:15] <averne> What's your usecase?

[23:37:21] <xperia64> averne: Mostly wanted to know if it had been attempted so as not to duplicate effort. Just picked up my first switch and was a little surprised to learn moonlight currently uses software decoding (that still seemingly deadlocks at times)

[23:44:55] <averne> xperia64: It's just obnoxious to get working because you can't rely on nvidia's driver stack, so you need to pretty much interact directly with the hardware through ioctls
[23:45:46] <averne> also depending on your approach, you might need a driver for VIC, another hardware engine that can accelerate YUV->RGB plane merging
[23:56:52] <xperia64> bleh, that's no fun; software decoding really isn't great (and h265 is unusable)
[23:57:43] <xperia64> guess I should just focus on figuring out why there are still video (presumably sw decoding) deadlocks
