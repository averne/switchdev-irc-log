[17:21:25] <Generic> I noticed something in the deko3d examples, though I'm not completely sure about it
[17:21:35] <Generic> https://github.com/switchbrew/switch-examples/blob/master/graphics/deko3d/deko_examples/source/Example02_Triangle.cpp#L203
[17:22:56] <Generic> if one first polls the input, then generates the data for the next frame and then waits for one fb of the swapchain to become available
[17:23:58] <Generic> doesn't this increase input latency, compared to acquiring a fb, then polling input and making the next frame?
