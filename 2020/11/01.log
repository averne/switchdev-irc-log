[01:01:41] <Behemoth> did you test the ns cmds before commiting to libnx?

[01:02:57] <Behemoth> I wish Nintendo wouldn't have used shared pointers for their ipc interfaces. It's such a pain to to find calls.
[01:05:07] <yellows8> iirc it may have thrown that same error here (was a good while ago)... but my system has domains blocked (and banned) anyway heh
[01:05:32] <Behemoth> heh

[01:11:46] <yellows8> "... find calls" are you using this or similar btw? https://github.com/hthh/switch-reversing/tree/master/pattern
[01:14:09] <Behemoth> yes
[01:14:17] <Behemoth> but ns stuff isn't in nnSdk
[01:14:33] <Behemoth> at least it never matches >.<
[01:15:03] <yellows8> meant nifm
[01:15:52] <Behemoth> yeah that works
[01:15:55] <Behemoth> I'll give it a try
[01:15:57] <Behemoth> thank
[01:16:00] <Behemoth> thanks*
[01:16:47] <yellows8> :)
[01:42:41] <Behemoth> Ok I got it to work.
[01:42:41] <Behemoth> Had to submit a NifmRequest first.
[01:42:41] <Behemoth> Wacky how this interface is detached from nifm::IsAnyInternetRequestAccepted
