[02:21:53] <CCFL_Man> yellows8: if you can run it without the full game itself
[02:22:13] <CCFL_Man> on earlier firmware that doesn't support jit
[02:35:15] <yellows8> .... just update?
[02:43:41] *** Joins zini
[02:44:48] <CCFL_Man> i was curious if the emulator can run without the game
[02:45:48] <yellows8> ....what?
[02:46:45] <CCFL_Man> meaning, execute the nro with associated files without 3d all stars
[02:48:06] <yellows8> the NRO is linked with the main-codebin obviously...
[02:48:15] <CCFL_Man> oh, i see
[02:49:09] <yellows8> (main-codebin is the actual emulator fwiw)

[02:53:40] <yellows8> so are you just wondering, or just don't want to update?(just use emummc if the latter?)
[02:54:41] <CCFL_Man> i don't want to update, but i was also wondering. 
[03:00:27] <CCFL_Man> if it was possible to copy over the directory to the sd card and execute the nro
[03:01:53] <yellows8> any reason you don't want to update, even (?) with emummc?(what's current sysver?)
[03:04:59] <CCFL_Man> i'm using 8.0.0 on reinx. i'll have to update reinx
[03:05:15] <CCFL_Man> but even on 10, would it run?
[03:05:33] <yellows8> ... use AMS
[03:05:42] *** Quits zini (Ping timeout: 745 seconds)
[03:06:22] <CCFL_Man> did NERD use the nro to run the emulator?
[03:07:31] <yellows8> AOT'd NRO for N64 is unused... it's never used with the ro-service
[03:09:16] <CCFL_Man> oh, i see now

[03:14:52] <CCFL_Man> you recommend atmopsphere instead of reinx?
[03:19:20] <yellows8> ... ofc
[03:23:53] <CCFL_Man> i know reinx hasn't been updated by the original author, but for a while, was it better than atmosphere, then atmosphere caught up?

[08:40:58] <IShaDoWl> nice talk over there
[08:43:03] <IShaDoWl> ams 0.13.0 states 
[08:43:05] <IShaDoWl> emummc was updated to include the new changes.
[08:43:05] <IShaDoWl> emummc now uses an updated/improved/faster SDMMC driver.
[08:43:05] <IShaDoWl> File-based emummc is now almost as fast as raw partition-based emummc.
[08:43:36] <IShaDoWl> Is SDMMC more recomended that partition based RAWMMC ?
