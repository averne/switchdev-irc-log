[02:41:48] <IShaDoWl> i think i hit a bug on daybreak 
[02:47:45] <IShaDoWl> not sure if this is the place but let me explain it
[02:52:02] *** Quits zini (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
[02:54:58] <IShaDoWl> sysnand 3.0 -> pegaScape DNS/90DNS -> wifi auth -> caffeine -> AMS@latest -> emuMMC -> daybreak (applet mode) -> update to 10.2 (Fat32 only) -> Everything ok -> Reboot -> noGC kicks In (1st weird thing if you dont press ok enought very fast the switch goes to sleep) -> wake switch -> press noGC ok fast -> joycon update popup appears -> update later -> shutdown switch from emuMMC -> power 
[02:54:59] <IShaDoWl> on switch arrive to sysnand -> in settings/system a warning appear saying an update is available.
[02:55:16] <IShaDoWl> if i click update now it launches pegaScape
[03:01:35] <IShaDoWl> if i go manteinance mode and click update now (to later cancel) it says 
[03:01:35] <IShaDoWl> preparing update....
[03:01:35] <IShaDoWl> This function is not available.
