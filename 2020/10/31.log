[05:16:05] <Behemoth> Is there anything that needs to be done before calling nifmIsAnyInternetRequestAccepted? Wanted to use some ns command and that always failed since the command internally returns 0 so 0x2a810 gets returned by libnx. The ns call works fine w/o.

[23:50:21] <Behemoth> You mean sth like 90dns blocking? Don't have that enabled.
[23:50:21] <Behemoth> Wrote a smoll program that updates all switch games since official software only updates the 10 last played ones.
[23:50:21] <Behemoth> It uses a shim of nsRequestUpdateApplication2 now w/o the nifm request.
