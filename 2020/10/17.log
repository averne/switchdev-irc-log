[23:53:31] *** Joins Generic
[23:54:00] <Generic> hello, I'm trying to get resolution switching for docked mode with deko3d going
[23:54:42] <Generic> my current approach is to create a 1920*1080 framebuffer
[23:55:49] <Generic> and then using Swapchain::SetCrop with the proper resolution
[23:56:14] <Generic> of course I also take the higher resolution into accoutn when setting the viewport/scissors
[23:57:51] <Generic> in the end the image is weirdly zoomed in docked mode
[23:57:59] <Generic> while everything works fine in handheld mode
[23:59:41] <Generic> if I remove the setCrop call it works in docked mode
[23:59:58] <Generic> but as expected in handheld mode the full hd framebuffer is drawn
