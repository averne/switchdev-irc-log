[03:05:57] <Behemoth> yellows8: turns out official software closes album before loginShare starts.
[03:09:41] <yellows8> figured
[03:10:38] <yellows8> what's the use-case for webapplet under LibraryApplet?
[03:25:27] <Behemoth> I made an album replacement with custom hoster support and still supporting Nintendo Share would be nice.
[03:25:27] <Behemoth> Also I need if for oauth but that's only for initial hoster setup so that's fine for application exclusive.
[03:28:54] <yellows8> ah
[03:31:05] <Behemoth> (also Nintendo Share somehow supports videos over 15Mb on twitter and my twitter api access doesn't)
[03:41:15] <yellows8> able to figure out how album does that special handling?(might be related to Jump?)

[10:15:25] <Behemoth> My RE game is weak but I could give it a try.
[10:16:07] <Behemoth> I failed at finding out how they round the video length in album. (It makes no sense

[11:21:38] <Behemoth> Oh JumpLibraryApplet is already in libnx
[11:56:34] <Behemoth> Yeah with jump it works
[11:56:34] <Behemoth> Was confused why it didn't initially. libapplet web doesn't use the libapplet launch proxy that checks the flag.
[12:13:25] *** averne_ is now known as averne
[12:16:58] <Behemoth> ofw actually sets a function pointer that's called in nn::applet::StartLibraryApplet instead of setting the jump flag
[12:25:27] *** Joins flewkey
[12:39:47] <Behemoth> Also ofw still uses ReserveToStartAndWaitAndUnwindThis while libnx only does that on <4.0.0
[12:39:48] <Behemoth> Do you know what the actual difference is? With ReserveToStartAndWait webapplet exits abnormally (0x290, qlaunch assert).
