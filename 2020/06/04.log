[23:12:49] <Behemoth> Do you know how OpenDataStorageByProgramId/OpenDataFileSystemByProgramId are supposed to work?
[23:12:50] <Behemoth> With programs that aren't running I get 0x339a02 (undocumented) bc it doesn't find it in a linked list.
[23:12:50] <Behemoth> With programs that _are_ running I get 0x320002 (access denied according to the wiki)
[23:13:20] *** Joins |Shadow|
[23:15:35] <Behemoth> It's not in libnx btw.
[23:15:35] <Behemoth> We plan to use it to access applet romfs to get access to their audio files without requiring the user to dump them or having to codewash to fit our license.
[23:22:28] <yellows8> dunno
[23:24:08] <Behemoth> Do you know of another way to mount applet romfs?
[23:24:11] <yellows8> are you testing this under hbl?
[23:24:17] <Behemoth> yes
[23:24:43] *** Joins coggy9
[23:25:03] <Behemoth> on album override I get it's contents with mount to self but for every title override it's the titles files.
[23:27:15] <Behemoth> *patching the access denied in fs works but that's undesireable and unmaintainable
[23:29:30] <yellows8> what are you patching? hbl is supposed to have fs_permissions={all} :/
[23:30:04] <Behemoth> it doesn't check those permissions here

[23:31:42] <Behemoth> 10.0.0 fs .text+0x74c20
[23:31:49] <Behemoth> tbh I have no idea what it verifies here
[23:33:33] <Behemoth> that's also called by OpenDataFileSystemWithProgramIndex & OpenDataStorageWithProgramIndex
[23:56:00] <yellows8> isn't this for a custom-libraryapplet? why does it need to access other-program-romfs?

[23:58:33] <Behemoth> The library I use (borealis) is made to mimic switch's UI and not just for library applet replacements.
[23:58:33] <Behemoth> Now we wanted to use the HOS sounds.
