[21:17:28] <madk> can someone give me a quick rundown on OpenGL and shaders and how to use them on the switch? Is it possible? I don't know much about graphics and I don't even know where to read. I looked at the examples repo but there were none using .vert and .frag files (the ones I want to compile / run)
[21:17:37] <madk> basically I'm trying to port a program idk what I'm doing.

[21:53:57] <averne> see https://github.com/switchbrew/switch-examples/blob/master/graphics/opengl/simple_triangle/source/main.cpp#L182-L208 for instance
[21:55:08] <averne> of course you can also load vertex sources from external files, see the romfs example if you want to see how to include files along with your executable
[21:59:07] <madk> thanks. Do you have a shader tutorial or how I can learn to write these? Is there any limitations to what the switch opengl implementation can do? Like I said I'm trying to port a program and it compiles fine but is just a blank screen. I have no idea what the shaders actually do so I need to rewrite it to use something simple I understand but idk where to learn to do this
[22:03:50] <uyjulian> Maybe try learning how to use shader on PC first. Easier to debug there too
[22:04:02] <averne> any opengl tutorial will cover shaders

[22:32:59] <madk> there are no special considerations for the switch?
[22:36:20] <uyjulian> The best way to know is to test it yourself
[22:38:13] <madk> well my shaders don't work
[22:38:38] <madk> but okay I'll figure out what's going on by learning wtf the code is doing lmao. I was just curious I guess if there was things to know about.
