[02:22:40] <TheLat> Is there a standard way for doing high-precision timers on the Switch?  I found this, but I would like to do this correctly:
[02:22:55] <TheLat> u64 elapsed = armGetSystemTick() - s_startTicks;
[02:23:00] <TheLat> return (elapsed * 625 / 12) / 1000000000.0;
[02:23:11] <TheLat> This appears to work correctly.

[04:47:38] <endrift> er
[04:47:42] <endrift> he's gone now but
[04:47:58] <endrift> it would probably be better to simplify that by doing return elapsed / 19200000.0;
[04:48:09] <endrift> you won't lose precision as badly that way
[04:48:31] <endrift> what is that value, anyway? 19.2 MHz?
[04:48:36] <endrift> Is that some base clock?
