[18:40:03] <lilibox> i tried simplegfx example with my own picture, 1280x720 worked fine, 1920x1080 displayed just 2/3 imag correct, rest was some kind of mess
[18:44:47] <lilibox> images format: Photoshop raw, no transparency, no header Interleaved Order, just RGB channels

[20:23:59] <yellows8> dunno, must be your image somehow *shrug*
[20:26:41] <lilibox> is it bad size?
[20:29:32] <yellows8> no (assuming 'B' is a typo)
[20:43:04] <lilibox> i meant B stands for Byte

[21:19:20] <lilibox> yellows8: if everything is ok at your side, could you send me your simplegfx folder, includes original image image, image.bin and .nro? i tried reexport my picture in gimp and i got same result :(
[21:21:26] <lilibox> dunno what is wrong, at mine side move 4 slashes in main.c shouldn't be so hard :)
