[02:17:23] <TheLat> Is it possible to do OpenGL coding for the Switch with glBegin(GL_QUADS); and the like?
[02:18:08] <TheLat> Code samples and the errors I'm getting at compile time are indicating that it is not, but I just want to check
[02:18:33] *** Joins eggster
[02:43:16] <endrift> I don't think GL_QUADS exists in anything other than 1.x
[02:43:23] *** Joins mukunda_
[02:44:29] <endrift> it's not in GLES 1.1, and I'm pretty sure it's not in 2.0 or GL 3.0
[02:45:29] <endrift> ah it's in GL 2.x and below, and that's it
[02:45:38] <endrift> anyway don't use it

[02:53:21] <TheLat> :(
[02:54:35] <TheLat> OK, I started this project in 2016.  What should I be using instead?
[02:54:58] <TheLat> It's OpenGL-based and draws a few hundred arbitrary quads per frame.
