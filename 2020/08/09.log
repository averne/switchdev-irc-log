[01:24:00] <TheLat> Hello!
[01:24:39] <TheLat> Can I bother someone for help with compiling https://github.com/switchbrew/switch-examples/tree/master/audio/sdl2-audio with MSYS2?
[01:24:52] <TheLat> I'm a horrible noob.
[01:27:14] <TheLat> I resolved the #include <immintrin.h> error and have updated the path variable so that it pulls in the SDL headers correctly.
[01:27:55] <TheLat> But I'm getting this error on running make:
[01:28:02] <TheLat> Package SDL2_mixer was not found in the pkg-config search path. Perhaps you should add the directory containing `SDL2_mixer.pc' to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable No package 'SDL2_mixer' found
[01:30:27] <TheLat> "echo $PKG_CONFIG_PATH" outputs "/mingw64/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/share/pkgconfig:/lib/pkgconfig" the first part of which does contain SDL2_mixer.pc
[01:32:34] <TheLat> This still produces a .nro, but that crashes on running on my Switch, presumable from the lack of SDL2_mixer.pc, but I am a noob, so I'm not sure.
[01:33:18] <TheLat> https://github.com/switchbrew/switch-examples/tree/master/graphics/opengl/textured_cube compiles and runs for me just fine.

[13:52:09] <carsten1> TheLat: can you pastebin the compilation log?
[14:02:21] <WntrMute> TheLat, Undo whatever it is you mean by "<TheLat> I resolved the #include <immintrin.h> error and have updated the path variable so that it pulls in the SDL headers correctly."
[14:03:22] <WntrMute> then, from msys2 shell run `pacman -S pkg-config switch-pkg-config`
[14:04:37] <WntrMute> sorry, just switch-pkg-config, you already have msys2 pkg-config installed
[14:05:51] <WntrMute> pacman -S switch-sdl2-libs might help too

[23:25:54] <TheLat> @WntrMute, I get "error: target not found" on everything except pkg-config
[23:27:19] <TheLat> I have reinstalled to be sure.
[23:29:04] <TheLat> "make -B --debug" outputs this:  https://pastebin.com/M6Y2iHwU
[23:31:24] <TheLat> Googling indicated that #include <immintrin.h> is unneeded and that I can just comment it out, so I did and I got this:  https://pastebin.com/F4TrpUwX
