[19:30:59] <TheLat> If anyone was curious, the compile error with the sdl audio example was because the make file was using "$(PREFIX)pkg-config --cflags SDL2_mixer" to generate parameters instead of "$(pkg-config --cflags SDL2_mixer)"
[19:57:36] <TheLat> I'm still getting the crash at startup error, but this is the output of "make -B --debug" now:  https://pastebin.com/ELagkrwx
[19:57:44] <TheLat> And I could use some help.
[20:00:51] <Stary> $(PREFIX)pkg-config -> aarch64-none-elf-pkg-config is a wrapper around system pkg-config that sets the right search path for portlibs and the correct cflags/ldflags/etc
[20:01:14] <Stary> the "warning: cannot find entry symbol _start; defaulting to 0000000000000040" is due to libnx not being linked -> crt not existing -> obviously not able to work
[20:01:51] <Stary> examples have been tested to compile out of the box with the right packages installed, you shouldn't have to hack up the makefiles to build them
[20:02:54] <TheLat> Should I just reinstall the whole thing from scratch?

[20:10:36] <WntrMute> TheLat, how did you install this in the first place?
[20:12:43] <WntrMute> reinstalling everything from scratch may well be in order since you fiddled with things that shouldn't be fiddled with but it would be useful to know how you started off
[20:14:02] <WntrMute> I don't really understand how you get "<TheLat> @WntrMute, I get "error: target not found" on everything except pkg-config" unless you're running pacman from an msys2 install that hasn't been set up with devkitPro repositories
[20:18:57] <TheLat> Linked to devkitpro from https://switchbrew.org/wiki/Main_Page
[21:18:53] <TheLat> OK, freshly reinstalled and now I'm getting this error when I try to make anything: "Makefile:10: /opt/devkitpro/libnx/switch_rules: No such file or directory make: *** No rule to make target '/opt/devkitpro/libnx/switch_rules'.  Stop."
[21:19:21] <TheLat> cd into /opt/devkitpro and there's most of the contents of where I installed devkitPro, but not libnx
[21:20:27] <TheLat> Note, freshly installed from here:  https://github.com/devkitPro/installer/releases
[21:21:06] <TheLat> Completely uninstalled msys2 and devkitpro for this reinstall.
[21:24:15] <Stary> make sure to install the switch-dev group if you didn't select it in the installer
[21:24:24] <Stary> in msys you can just do pacman -S switch-dev or so

[21:35:36] <Stary> ugh, this is msys breakage - see https://www.msys2.org/news/#2020-06-29-new-packagers for details on how to update the msys keyring manually
[21:36:31] <TheLat_> Thank you!
[21:42:47] <Stary> huh, i don't get that issue installing on windows - maybe you have some stuff cached
[21:44:04] <WntrMute> Um, most likely culprit is still having an old copy of msys-2.10.0.7z
