[14:29:38] <WntrMute> TheLat, googling is unlikely to tell you anything useful tbh
[14:30:47] <WntrMute> Your problem is @Package SDL2_mixer was not found in the pkg-config search path@
[14:31:15] <WntrMute> meh, keyboard has changed mapping on me again :P
[14:31:48] <WntrMute> anyway, that's the *only* relevant error. *Everything* else stems from that

[17:11:07] <TheLat> How do I fix the pkg-config search path?
