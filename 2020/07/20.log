[21:39:06] <leo60228> Could someone with more experience with libnx internals look at this PR? https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/74567
[22:03:51] <endrift> now I wish I knew Rust
[22:03:58] <endrift> (wait, I usually wish I knew Rust)
[22:04:36] <endrift> also: thanks for basing the Docker image off of the upstream image instead of trying to build your own. It gets frustrating when they don't match.
