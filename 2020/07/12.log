[17:03:15] <poopycode> hi, any idea why exceptions emanating from hardware breakpoints don't show up when attached to a process and calling svcGetDebugEvent()?

[17:08:52] <poopycode> doing the same thing with "twili" (after patching it to add hw bp support) does catch the BP as expected. Meanwhile my own kernel module sets things up just as twili does but no luck.
