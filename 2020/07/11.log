[00:06:04] *** Joins poopycode
[00:10:39] <poopycode> Hello, i wrote some toy debugger in the shape of a kernel module. When pumping debug events i can observe events as expected (attach/new_thread etc...) yet it won't show a hardware breakpoint. What am i doing wrong?
[00:12:35] <poopycode> (hw_bp_syscall does return 0. Also calling it with the same arguments using a twili-gdb patched to that effect does work as intended, ie: catching the damn bp) 
[00:14:33] <poopycode> I read "https://switchbrew.org/wiki/SVC#Exception handling" multiple times but i'm somehow stupid.
