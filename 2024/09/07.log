[19:38:07] <tom2199> Hello guys, I hope this is the right place to ask this question. I want to check if my Switch is on (for home automation purposes). So I found an old project named sys-http, which gives a health check via http. The problem is, every half hour or so the switch wakes up and answers the request, even if it's not on. (The same thing happens when I ping the Switch, that's why I wanted to do this via sys-http).
[19:38:36] <tom2199> So my idea is to change sys-http just a little bit by checking if the switch is on somehow before answering the request. Is there a Atmosphere/HOS-Function for this? Maybe check if the green light from the dock is on or something? I hope someone familiar with Atmosphere and it's libraries can give me a hint. Help would be much appreciated!
[19:39:06] <tom2199> Here's the project and the line I want to change: https://github.com/zaksabeast/sys-http/blob/fd818dfff5c467f749ebf372c1a741061ba0a7b3/source/main.cpp#L112
