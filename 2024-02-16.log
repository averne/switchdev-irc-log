[15:19:15] <CCFL_Man> has there been a single cause why when you try to boot atmosphere, the screen will go black after the atmosphere logos?
[15:20:32] <CCFL_Man> i'm using exfat on a switch lite and mariko, 14.1.0 and 15.0.0 respectively, and even trying early versions of atmosphere, it still goes black
[15:20:56] <CCFL_Man> i was reading that it's a common problem, but no one was able to pinpoint it
[15:21:11] <CCFL_Man> and there does not seem to be a way to debug
